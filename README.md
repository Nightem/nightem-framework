# nightem-framework âš  Work in progress
Full-stack framework offering back-end and front-end. Communicating cohesively through developer-defined API urls.

The aim of Nightem framework was to integrate a version of Laravel and Vue together, allowing for seamless usage
without the trouble of having to make the two work together. Nightem is also a primarily SPA focussed framework,
but allows developers to make the choice between SPA or standard, PHP routing or JS routing and more.

*the Nightem framework is a trial and error project made additionally to learn the core of frameworks and the way they work hehind the scenes*

## ***ðŸ’¡ Nightem software***
The Nightem framework is developed and maintained by the [Nightem software foundation](https://wolfsvale.tech).
Dedicated to open source development and transparency, the Nightem software foundation aims to provide next-generation
software with user-friendliness, optimization, speed and transparency as a priority.

The Nightem framework can be found across applications developed by Nightem *in the future*.

To provide security and safety in requests, the Nightem framework uses
[the http-foundation component](https://github.com/symfony/http-foundation).

---

The Nightem framework will support and provide:
- Routing through PHP (file navigation) or Javascript (SPA navigation)
- Model-View-Controller framework with automatic detection
- Built-in i18n functionality (Crowdin integration?)
- SQL query-free database navigation and commands
- Built-in server management
- Built-in asset management
- Built in authentication management
- Built in user group management
- Variety of custom storage modules
- Organised and readable structure
- Easily manageable storage disks for assets
- Built-in API request module for front-to-back communication.
- Secure HTTP requests and connections
- component-based development
- Reactive/Dynamic display of components
- Built-in DOM manipulation methods
- Database seeding
- Database migration system
- Action and loading based execution states
- Built in user-based and/or group-based permission system

These are the core parts of the Nightem framework, and while it may seem similar to what Laravel/Vue support together,
It is assured that the Nightem framework handles these all differently. The migration system for example will not
be in order of creation, but rather in order of priority, as defined within the migration.

In the future, a dashboard may be added for easier management of the Nightem framework.

### WARNING
All plans stated here may change in the future. This is a rough sketch of what the Nightem framework intends to be.
There is no guarantee that all will follow the exact plans stated.
